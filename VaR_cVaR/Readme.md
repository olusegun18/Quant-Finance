Crptocurrency assets are very volatile. This project is just to take a brief exploration into the volatile behaviour of three crypto assets (BTC, ETH, and USDT). The analysis covers a 5yr period up until July 10, 2022. There are numerous models to assess the risk of financial assets. In this notbook, I will use Value at
Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), VaR using a parametric method with a normal distribution, and Monte Carlo simulations.
